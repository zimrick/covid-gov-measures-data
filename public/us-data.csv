Asymptomatic spreaders are a major reason containing this virus has been so challenging.  To take action early if you do have COVID-19.  If you are in the early stages of a COVID-19 infection, detecting it early allows you to quickly isolate, rest and recuperate, monitor your symptoms and seek medical care if needed.  To spend time with friends and family--especially those at high risk.  If you plan to spend a prolonged period of time with loved ones, especially older adults or those with underlying conditions, stay away from high risk activities for 10 days and then get tested.  To help get the virus under control.  Widespread testing among healthy people helps to stop the spread of COVID-19. Screening healthy people, staying on top of positive cases, identifying new outbreaks quickly, and being aware of how the virus spreads among people without symptoms, are powerful tools in our efforts to suppress the virus.  It is important to remember that a COVID-19 test is a one-time assessment, and will only show if you are infected at the time of the test. Everyday prevention measures, such as handwashing, physical distancing and mask-wearing should always be practiced, even after you have been tested.

The new DHMs change some of the restrictions put in place to help manage the coronavirus pandemic.     Nebraska’s pandemic response plan links DHM restrictions to the percentage of staffed hospital beds in Nebraska filled by coronavirus patients.  The percentage is below 10% (7-day rolling average), which is the threshold for the State moving to the “green” phase of its pandemic plan.    Moving from the “blue” to “green” phase involves the following DHM change:    The maximum capacity for indoor gatherings, including youth extracurricular activities, goes from 75% to 100%.  Organizers of gatherings of 500 or more people (1,000 or more in Douglas County), must still submit a reopening plan to their local health department—and receive approval—before holding their events.

This season is traditionally very challenging in terms of maintaining adequate blood supplies in our state and country.    This is due to the holidays; winter weather; and the prevalence of cold, flu, and other seasonal illnesses in the community.  We’re asking Nebraskans to step up to donate blood and sponsor blood drives.  A shortage of blood may affect people who need emergency surgery, victims of accidents, and cancer patients in need of periodic transfusion.  One single blood donation can potentially save three lives.  The pandemic has caused the cancellation of many blood drives.  In Nebraska alone, we’ve seen over 1,300 blood drives cancelled since the beginning of the pandemic, leading to the projected loss of around 35,000 units of collected blood.  Blood drives are conducted with the highest standards of safety and infection control.  All staff and donors are subjected to health screenings, everyone wears a mask during the process, social distancing is maintained, and there’s an aggressive program of disinfection at each collection station.  The American Red Cross tests all blood donations for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies.  Individuals interested in donating blood are encouraged to go to redcross.org and make an appointment to donate.  Appointments are required in order to maintain social distancing.  Organizations interested in sponsoring a blood drive can also submit an application on the website.    http://web.archive.org/web/20201221205435/https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-highlights-start-coronavirus-vaccinations-calls-nebraskans-donate-blood",3,"On January 26, Test Nebraska sites in Lincoln and Omaha will be open today following Monday’s winter storm, but will open at 11 a.m., instead of regular opening time.

Your positive case is then shared with your Local Health Department, who will call you to determine close contacts that you may have spread the virus to.  A close contact is anyone you spent 15 minutes or more with over a 24-hour period and were within 6 feet of while you were infectious (2 days before onset of symptoms to 10 days after, or two days before your positive test if you didn't have any symptoms).

NOTE: Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status  Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, how they should monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.
