Now, we can make it faster and easier to resolve a household’s crisis situation.”    When a household’s energy source has been shut off or is at risk of disconnection, the winter Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP), which runs November through May, pays the minimum amount needed on the fuel bill to get the household out of crisis. Starting this winter, ECIP will pledge the maximum disconnect amount (up to $800) toward an eligible participant’s owed balance.    “Winter can be especially harsh for low-income Missourians, and we must do all that we can to assure they can heat their homes to remain safe and healthy,” said Missouri Department of Social Services Acting Director Jennifer Tidball.    In FY2020, Missouri provided $78.6 million in LIHEAP assistance to over 108,000 households. In addition to meeting the income criteria, low-income Missourians must also meet the following criteria to be eligible for winter heating assistance through LIHEAP:    Be responsible for paying home heating costs,  Have $3,000 or less in bank accounts, retirement accounts, or investments, and  Be a U.S. citizen or legally admitted for permanent residence.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210222211224/https://governor.mo.gov/press-releases/archive/governor-parson-announces-improved-home-heating-bill-assistance-through  ",1,NO FLAG,"Originally coded a 2, but since this appears to be an extension of the existing moratorium in place since December 27 rather than an additional form of debt relief, moves back down to a 1.

Last fall, DHSS began reporting statewide numbers of reported negative and positive antigen tests.     DHSS will follow the guidance of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) – the independent professional body that determines case definitions for the country. CSTE guidance subsequently affirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that someone who has a positive antigen test for COVID-19 should be considered a probable case rather than confirmed.     Laboratory-based PCR tests continue to be the primary system and the gold standard for testing throughout the COVID-19 response as they provide a more definitive answer as to whether an individual has the virus in their body. Since last summer, antigen testing has significantly increased in availability and use. Like PCR testing, antigen testing is used to determine whether someone is actively infected with COVID-19, but these tests can generate results much quicker and do not require laboratory processing. Both probable and confirmed cases receive the same level of case investigation and follow-up.     In addition to probable cases for each county being displayed on the dashboard, county-level data showing tests and positivity rate are also available. The data is broken out by PCR/confirmed and antigen/probable.    “Antigen testing has been and continues to be a very effective tool as part of our mitigation strategy, and the use of this test has greatly increased in recent months,” said Dr. Randall Williams, director of DHSS. “Although the rate of community transmission continues to drop significantly throughout Missouri, having probable case information available for each county will help guide ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20210310002203/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/746a0fe9-48b5-4516-adaa-15bee13f6a7b/state-adds-county-level-antigen-test-data-to-online-public-health-dashboard  ",1,NO FLAG,"On February 26, the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Service published that variants of the COVID-19 virus continue to develop around the world, and scientists in the United States and around the world continue to monitor them for their characteristics as they relate to infectivity, morbidity and response to available vaccines and treatments.

The state has identified 161 pharmacies in 84 counties based on ability, location, and population. These pharmacies have the ability to administer 200 initial doses of COVID-19 vaccines per week and will consistently receive this number of doses in addition to booster doses for the next three to four weeks. To view the list of participating pharmacies, click here.    The Missouri Pharmacy Association will submit orders to the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) on behalf of partnering pharmacies. Missourians are encouraged to use the state’s vaccinator map at MOStopsCOVID.com to find participating pharmacies in their area or reach out to local pharmacies directly.     Allocations for each of Missouri’s vaccine delivery channels will be adjusted accordingly to accommodate pharmacies. Delivery channels and corresponding allocations through the week of March 22 are as follows:    High Throughput Health Centers: 35 percent  Mass Vaccination Events: 15 percent   Local Public Health Agencies: 15 percent  Federally Qualified Health Centers: 15 percent   Other Community/Enrolled Providers: 5 percent   Pharmacies: 15 percent   Starting the week of March 29, the state will shift vaccine allocations to reflect unvaccinated eligible populations in each of Missouri’s nine regions. Current delivery channels will be modified to incorporate those changes.    Also during today’s briefing, Governor Parson outlined modifications to state sponsored mass vaccination clinics.    “While distribution is equitable based on population throughout each region, we do recognize that some Missourians are less interested in receiving a vaccine than others,” said Governor Parson. “Vaccine interest is often highest in urban populations, so starting next week, we will begin transitioning mass vaccination teams to accommodate more events in the Kansas City and St. Louis regions.”     Starting the week of March 8, mass vaccination teams will begin transitioning operations to include a larger presence in Region A (Kansas City) and Region C (St. Louis). Eventually, two teams will be operational in Region A and three teams will be operational in Region C. The state expects a full transition by April 1. This timeline will allow vaccination teams to complete booster clinics for previous Moderna and Pfizer events and transition to the single dose Janssen vaccine.     Both mass and targeted vaccination events hosted by the state will begin utilizing the Janssen vaccine as supply allows. This will help increase the scale and efficiency of state sponsored clinics as vaccination teams will not need to return to locations for booster (second) dose vaccinations.     Missourians are encouraged to visit MOStopsCOVID.com to view the latest vaccine updates, find out when they are eligible for the vaccine, and locate available vaccinators in their area.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210310002829/https://governor.mo.gov/press-releases/archive/governor-parson-announces-additional-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-channel"

The program, funded through the U.S. Treasury as part of a federal coronavirus relief package, is available to eligible tenants and landlords.  The State’s program provides assistance for both rent and certain utilities. The program is available for renters and not homeowners according to federal guidance.          Some localities in Nebraska are receiving federal funds directly, and they will operate rental assistance programs separately from the State.  These include the City of Lincoln, the City of Omaha, Douglas County, and Lancaster County.  Residents in these locations will need to apply through their jurisdiction’s program rather than through the State’s program.         The Nebraska Investment Finance Authority (NIFA) is coordinating with the State to administer the rental assistance program.  Shannon Harner, NIFA’s Executive Director, joined the Governor to discuss who is eligible and how to apply.  Starting today, Nebraskans can apply online at coronavirus.nebraska.gov.           At this morning’s press conference, Gov. Ricketts also proclaimed February 20-27 as “FFA Week” in Nebraska.  State FFA President Madison Stracke of Stuart spoke about activities FFA has planned in 2021.  Nebraska FFA Foundation board member Lance Atwater—who farms near Ayr, Nebraska—talked about his personal experiences with FFA and its benefits to the state.         Shannon Harner: Emergency Rental Assistance Program    NIFA is the State of Nebraska’s Housing Finance Agency, and, as such, it is appropriate that we work in partnership with the State to ensure the success of this program.  It is our commitment to quickly communicate the availability and guidelines of this program to those most in need, in order to keep Nebraska renters safely housed, and Nebraska landlords able to pay the mortgages on their rental units.  The latest round of coronavirus relief funding provided Nebraska with $200 million of Emergency Rental Assistance funding.  Of this amount, $158 million will be administered and distributed by the State to persons in all counties other than Douglas and Lancaster, which, along with Omaha and Lincoln, received separate funds.  Applicants residing in these areas will have the ability to apply to those respective programs around the beginning of March, with more information to be provided as it becomes available.  If the separate area funds are fully exhausted, and need still exists in those areas, the remaining State fund will then become available to persons in those areas.  The State’s program provides assistance for both rent and certain tenant-paid utilities such as electricity, gas, water, sewer, and garbage services.    Application approval requires:  A copy of the current lease with the applicant as a party to that lease.  Contact with the landlord for verification of current tenancy, amounts due, or other application information.  A demonstrated loss of household income as a result, either directly or indirectly, of COVID-19.  When an application for assistance is approved, payment will be made directly to the landlord or utility providers on behalf of the tenant.  Either the landlord or the tenant may apply for this assistance.  Both the landlord and the tenant will be required to verify information and provide relevant documentation.  Only tenants whose household income is verified as less than 80% of the average median income of their county are eligible for assistance.  During the application process, required documents will be uploaded directly to the portal.  The portal is mobile friendly to make the application process as easy as possible even for people without a home computer.  NIFA’s website (www.nifa.org) and YouTube channels will have additional training materials and webinars about the program.  A call center is available to provide assistance from Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm (CT) and, at least the first weekend, on Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (CT).

Oregon,OR,Thu 11 Mar 2021,1,2,0,"""Gov. Kate Brown orders Oregon schools to shift into in-person instruction by spring break    Virtual learning will soon become the exception rather than the rule in Oregon’s public schools.    Elementary schools should begin offering classroom instruction by March 29, Gov. Kate Brown said Friday. Three weeks later, on April 19, middle and high schools should do the same.    “Whether or not public schools should return kids to the classroom this spring is no longer up for discussion,” Brown said in a release.    The governor is ordering the Oregon Health Authority and the Department of Education to revise their guidelines on how to operate schools during the pandemic by March 19.    Virtual learning will still be an option for families but districts must default to offering either full in-person instruction or a hybrid model based on community infection rates, Brown said.    The announcement came nearly one year after she initially ordered a two-week closure to curb the spread of coronavirus.    Districts that fail to meet Brown’s deadlines risk losing some state funding but spokesperson Charles Boyle told The Oregonian/OregonLive the governor doesn’t believe that will happen based on conversations she’s had with local leaders.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210307045822/https://www.oregonlive.com/education/2021/03/gov-kate-brown-orders-oregon-schools-to-prioritize-in-person-instruction-by-spring-break.html",2,1,"Effective February 12 through February 25, there will be 14 counties in the Extreme Risk level, 11 at High Risk, two at Moderate Risk, and nine at Lower Risk.
