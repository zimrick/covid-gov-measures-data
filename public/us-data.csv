Now, we can make it faster and easier to resolve a household’s crisis situation.”    When a household’s energy source has been shut off or is at risk of disconnection, the winter Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP), which runs November through May, pays the minimum amount needed on the fuel bill to get the household out of crisis. Starting this winter, ECIP will pledge the maximum disconnect amount (up to $800) toward an eligible participant’s owed balance.    “Winter can be especially harsh for low-income Missourians, and we must do all that we can to assure they can heat their homes to remain safe and healthy,” said Missouri Department of Social Services Acting Director Jennifer Tidball.    In FY2020, Missouri provided $78.6 million in LIHEAP assistance to over 108,000 households. In addition to meeting the income criteria, low-income Missourians must also meet the following criteria to be eligible for winter heating assistance through LIHEAP:    Be responsible for paying home heating costs,  Have $3,000 or less in bank accounts, retirement accounts, or investments, and  Be a U.S. citizen or legally admitted for permanent residence.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210222211224/https://governor.mo.gov/press-releases/archive/governor-parson-announces-improved-home-heating-bill-assistance-through",1,NO FLAG,"Originally coded a 2, but since this appears to be an extension of the existing moratorium in place since December 27 rather than an additional form of debt relief, moves back down to a 1.

Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status  Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, how they should monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.
