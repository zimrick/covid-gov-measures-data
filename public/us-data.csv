P-EBT funds are being issued for the 2020-2021 school year beginning in late June 2021.    Children that attended a school that reported days missed due to COVID-19 are eligible for P-EBT. A child qualifies for P-EBT if:    They qualified for free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program, and,  The child did not receive free or reduced-price meals at school because the school was closed or operated with reduced attendance or hours for at least five consecutive days due to COVID-19.  School children do not have to be on the food assistance program through DCF to receive this special P-EBT benefit.    Additionally, children under the age of 6 in a household that received food assistance in Kansas at any time since October 1, 2020 are eligible for P-EBT benefits if they live or attend a childcare facility in an area where one or more schools were closed or operating with reduced attendance or hours.    “This year, the P-EBT benefit has been expanded to include youth in childcare facilities who were affected by the pandemic,” said Kansas DCF Secretary Laura Howard. “This program is essential to families who are experiencing food insecurity and don’t always know where their next meal will come from.”    P-EBT benefit amounts will vary by child based on that child’s learning situation. The specific benefit amount per child will be provided to the household on the approval notice received in the mail. Families will receive their benefits on a new or their existing Kansas Benefits Card (EBT Card).    For households that already receive public assistance through DCF, the P-EBT benefit will be automatically issued to the household’s Kansas Benefits Card (EBT Card). Benefits will be issued in one lump sum, staggered over 10 days in June 2021 for the months of August 2020 through May 2021. An application through DCF is not needed.  Households that do not receive public assistance must apply through the DCF self-service portal, https://cssp.kees.ks.gov/apspssp/sspNonMed.portal, using a unique identifier received from their school. The application process is estimated to start July 12.  Recipients can use their P-EBT funds to purchase eligible foods from approved retailers that accept food assistance benefits, like grocery stores and online at Aldi, Amazon or Walmart.

It's time that we end these programs that have ultimately incentivized people to stay out of the workforce.”     “As I travel the state, from Sarcoxie to Hannibal and all points in between, over-arching concerns from business owners is the shortage of employees,” Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe said. “Across every industry, businesses cannot compete against federal largesse. Our economy is built upon an active and vibrant workforce, and we should be cultivating job-creation and employment rather than inhibiting them. The jobs exist and the demand exists, and I applaud the governor for taking this bold and decisive action.”    The termination announced today applies to the following programs:    Pandemic Unemployment Assistance;  Emergency Unemployment Relief for Government Entities and Nonprofit Organizations;  Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation;  Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation;  100 Percent Reimbursement of Short-Time Compensation Benefit Costs Paid Under State Law; and   Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation.   “We know that one of the last remaining hurdles to full economic recovery is addressing this labor shortage. Even with unemployment at only 4.2 percent, there are still 221,266 known job postings across the state,” Governor Parson said. “The solution to close this gap is not the excessive spending of taxpayer dollars by the federal government, but rather getting people back to work and to a sense of normalcy for themselves and their families. Today’s action ensures that we will fill existing jobs as well as the thousands of new jobs coming to our state as businesses continue to invest and expand in Missouri.”     In a letter to the U.S. Department of Labor, Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Director Anna Hui gave notice of Missouri’s intention to terminate all federal pandemic-related unemployment programs. To view the letter, see attachment.     “During the last recession in 2008, the federal government contributed $25 per week to supplement state unemployment benefits. During the latest economic downturn, Washington poured in $600 per week in addition to Missouri’s weekly benefit of up to $320,” said Director Hui.      “Even after the original $600 supplement expired, it was replaced by a federal supplement that provides an extra $300 per week on top of Missouri’s existing state benefit, meaning thousands of claimants continue to receive $620 per week or more,” Director Hui continued. “The unemployment system is designed to provide a temporary safety net as workers look to reenter the job market. Leaving the level of benefits artificially high would prevent a return to full employment in our state.”    Today’s action follows steps taken last July to require claimants to again conduct weekly work searches in order to be eligible for unemployment benefits. This work search requirement had originally been waived in March of 2020 as part of an agreement with the federal government to receive funds under the CARES Act.     Under Missouri’s law, claimants are required to perform and report three work search activities per week. Qualified work search activities include filing an application (online or in-person) with an employer or through job posting sites or attending a job fair, job interview, reemployment service, or skills workshop.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210517134411/https://governor.mo.gov/press-releases/archive/governor-parson-announces-missouri-end-all-federal-pandemic-related",1,NO FLAG,"No new updates.
