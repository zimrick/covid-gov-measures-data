Now, we can make it faster and easier to resolve a household’s crisis situation.”    When a household’s energy source has been shut off or is at risk of disconnection, the winter Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP), which runs November through May, pays the minimum amount needed on the fuel bill to get the household out of crisis. Starting this winter, ECIP will pledge the maximum disconnect amount (up to $800) toward an eligible participant’s owed balance.    “Winter can be especially harsh for low-income Missourians, and we must do all that we can to assure they can heat their homes to remain safe and healthy,” said Missouri Department of Social Services Acting Director Jennifer Tidball.

DHSS will follow the guidance of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) – the independent professional body that determines case definitions for the country. CSTE guidance subsequently affirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that someone who has a positive antigen test for COVID-19 should be considered a probable case rather than confirmed.     Laboratory-based PCR tests continue to be the primary system and the gold standard for testing throughout the COVID-19 response as they provide a more definitive answer as to whether an individual has the virus in their body. Since last summer, antigen testing has significantly increased in availability and use. Like PCR testing, antigen testing is used to determine whether someone is actively infected with COVID-19, but these tests can generate results much quicker and do not require laboratory processing. Both probable and confirmed cases receive the same level of case investigation and follow-up.     In addition to probable cases for each county being displayed on the dashboard, county-level data showing tests and positivity rate are also available. The data is broken out by PCR/confirmed and antigen/probable.    “Antigen testing has been and continues to be a very effective tool as part of our mitigation strategy, and the use of this test has greatly increased in recent months,” said Dr. Randall Williams, director of DHSS. “Although the rate of community transmission continues to drop significantly throughout Missouri, having probable case information available for each county will help guide ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20210310002203/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/746a0fe9-48b5-4516-adaa-15bee13f6a7b/state-adds-county-level-antigen-test-data-to-online-public-health-dashboard  ",1,NO FLAG,"On February 26, the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Service published that variants of the COVID-19 virus continue to develop around the world, and scientists in the United States and around the world continue to monitor them for their characteristics as they relate to infectivity, morbidity and response to available vaccines and treatments.

Source: https://archive.ph/fXyAZ",2,1,"On February 22,Governor Pete Ricketts hosted a press conference at the State Capitol to announce the launch of the State’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program.  The program, funded through the U.S. Treasury as part of a federal coronavirus relief package, is available to eligible tenants and landlords.  The State’s program provides assistance for both rent and certain utilities. The program is available for renters and not homeowners according to federal guidance.          Some localities in Nebraska are receiving federal funds directly, and they will operate rental assistance programs separately from the State.  These include the City of Lincoln, the City of Omaha, Douglas County, and Lancaster County.  Residents in these locations will need to apply through their jurisdiction’s program rather than through the State’s program.         The Nebraska Investment Finance Authority (NIFA) is coordinating with the State to administer the rental assistance program.  Shannon Harner, NIFA’s Executive Director, joined the Governor to discuss who is eligible and how to apply.  Starting today, Nebraskans can apply online at coronavirus.nebraska.gov.           At this morning’s press conference, Gov. Ricketts also proclaimed February 20-27 as “FFA Week” in Nebraska.  State FFA President Madison Stracke of Stuart spoke about activities FFA has planned in 2021.  Nebraska FFA Foundation board member Lance Atwater—who farms near Ayr, Nebraska—talked about his personal experiences with FFA and its benefits to the state.         Shannon Harner: Emergency Rental Assistance Program    NIFA is the State of Nebraska’s Housing Finance Agency, and, as such, it is appropriate that we work in partnership with the State to ensure the success of this program.  It is our commitment to quickly communicate the availability and guidelines of this program to those most in need, in order to keep Nebraska renters safely housed, and Nebraska landlords able to pay the mortgages on their rental units.  The latest round of coronavirus relief funding provided Nebraska with $200 million of Emergency Rental Assistance funding.  Of this amount, $158 million will be administered and distributed by the State to persons in all counties other than Douglas and Lancaster, which, along with Omaha and Lincoln, received separate funds.  Applicants residing in these areas will have the ability to apply to those respective programs around the beginning of March, with more information to be provided as it becomes available.  If the separate area funds are fully exhausted, and need still exists in those areas, the remaining State fund will then become available to persons in those areas.  The State’s program provides assistance for both rent and certain tenant-paid utilities such as electricity, gas, water, sewer, and garbage services.    Application approval requires:  A copy of the current lease with the applicant as a party to that lease.  Contact with the landlord for verification of current tenancy, amounts due, or other application information.  A demonstrated loss of household income as a result, either directly or indirectly, of COVID-19.  When an application for assistance is approved, payment will be made directly to the landlord or utility providers on behalf of the tenant.  Either the landlord or the tenant may apply for this assistance.  Both the landlord and the tenant will be required to verify information and provide relevant documentation.  Only tenants whose household income is verified as less than 80% of the average median income of their county are eligible for assistance.  During the application process, required documents will be uploaded directly to the portal.  The portal is mobile friendly to make the application process as easy as possible even for people without a home computer.  NIFA’s website (www.nifa.org) and YouTube channels will have additional training materials and webinars about the program.  A call center is available to provide assistance from Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm (CT) and, at least the first weekend, on Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (CT).

The new process is being immediately rolled out this week after a successful weekend pilot in which more than 1,800 people were able to secure vaccination appointments.    The new appointment scheduling process applies to eligible older adults who live in Clackamas, Columbia, Multnomah or Washington counties who registered for a vaccine through the Get Vaccinated Oregon (GVO) tool. Seniors in other counties around the state also can use the Get Vaccinated Oregon tool to register for notifications and find information about vaccination events in their area, but locations and steps will differ in their counties.    For Portland metro area seniors, OHA is pulling names from the Get Vaccinated Oregon tool.  OHA will send those individuals an advance email indicating they will be receiving an email from All4Oregon inviting them to make an appointment at OCC.    That message from OHA will be followed by an email from All4Oregon that contains a unique individualized link that connects to the All4Oregon scheduling site with open dates and times for vaccines available the next week.  This link will expire if not used within 5 days.    Last week, schedulers made appointments for 1,950 people via phone call. To improve upon this manual and time intensive process, this new approach will now allow for much faster appointing and at higher volumes, which will be needed as vaccine supply expands.    All4Oregon will contact individuals either by phone or email. The COVID-19 mass vaccination site at the Oregon Convention Center is expected to fill all of its available vaccine appointments this week using one of these two methods. OHA’s commitment of a minimum of 15,000 doses per week through the end of the month is being made to enable OCC to offer older adults the opportunity to schedule weeks in advance, so more people will know they have an appointment and when they’re scheduled to get vaccinated, reducing potential worry and uncertainty. Once an appointment is made, individuals can cancel or change their appointment by calling 2-1-1 and selecting the option for the All4Oregon Call Center.    People who have provided Get Vaccinated Oregon with their email should check all email inbox folders, including spam, promotion and trash, in the event the invitation is inadvertently directed there.    The new technology was developed by Epic, the electronic medical record provider for the four health systems operating All4Oregon. Legacy Health, which offered to run the appointment system, reached out to Epic after experiencing network issues when an estimated 400,000 people tried to get one of the small numbers of open appointments over the past two weeks. As more vaccine becomes available, the system will be able to scale up to meet the increased demand.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210315212106/https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDHS/bulletins/2c5bf09"

Texas,TX,Thu 25 Mar 2021,1,2,0,"As of March 21, 2021 the Texas schools still have freedom to decide whether or not to follow the Texas Education Agency (TEA) released guidelines based on the new executive order GA 34. Under TEA guidelines, masks should be worn by students, teachers and staff members, whenever it is not possible to maintain 6 feet social distancing. TEA recommends that public school systems consult with their local public health authorities and local legal counsel before making final decisions regarding the implementation of this guidance.    Most Texas school districts remain open, but also offer virtual learning. Many continue to provide daily, on-campus learning for any family who wants it in order to not lose state funding due to declines in enrollment. School districts can require individual students who are falling behind academically to return to in-person classes.    Mostly all Texas Universities have chosen to keep COVID-19 policies in place, even though Governor Abbott has ended the mask mandate. Many Texas universities are also on Spring break. While some schools are choosing to provide students a full spring break, others have shortened it and instead provided various mental health holidays throughout the rest of the school year.

West Virginia,WV,Thu 25 Mar 2021,1,1,0,"On February 23rd the West Virginia Board of Education (WVBE) passed a motion requiring grades pre-k to 8 to return to full, five-day instruction in the state.

The board recommended high schools return to five days of in-person instruction as well.
