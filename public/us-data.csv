Missouri,MO,Thu 06 May 2021,1,1,1,"On March 24, the University of Missouri published a press release about workers. Dear University faculty and staff,    Throughout this last year, you have proven yourselves resilient in a time of great uncertainty and steady change. We so appreciate your willingness to step up and keep us going.    Thankfully, effective – and increasingly available – COVID-19 vaccines, along with a decrease in active cases in our region, usher in new possibilities for how we can interact.    Next Monday (March 29), all of you, as higher education faculty and staff (including student employees), will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We strongly encourage you to sign up for a vaccine appointment. Please see our vaccine page here for links to options, which includes information to make an appointment as dates become available at our Faurot Field vaccine site. There, dedicated MU Health Care teams have already vaccinated nearly 23,000 people.    Over the last several months, many of you safely returned to in-person work, following our COVID-19 guidelines. Meanwhile in our community, public schools have announced plans to shift to full in-person attendance in early April and this week, Boone County relaxed public health orders. We expect this progress to continue as we approach fall and our plans to resume full-capacity classes and activities here at Mizzou.    As another step toward resuming our pre-pandemic lives, we ask faculty and staff who have not yet returned to in-person work to do so by May 17. Faculty on 9-month appointments without duties over the summer should plan to return in August. We are sending this message in advance to give you and your supervisor time to make a transition plan if needed.    As more faculty and staff return, we remain committed to sustaining a safe community. Social distancing and face covering requirements will continue until public health guidance changes. Supervisors will need to ensure work settings meet office safety expectations and consult with Campus Facilities if work spaces need modification.    We know ongoing efforts to maximize our resources, including the recent announcement to close buildings, mean some in-person offices will not be the same. In addition, we realize, in some settings, social distancing is not possible with a full in-person return and that factor should be considered in any transition plan. If you witness an unsafe situation at work related to our COVID-19 protocols, you should let your supervisor know or submit a concern here.    Through this transition, we expect to retain some of our COVID-era practices, as we found some enhanced our work. In some circumstances, supervisors may decide flexible work arrangements will best fit the environment and the work needed to support the university’s mission. If so, your supervisor will initiate, revise or extend a telework arrangement. The form is available on our Working Through COVID-19 webpage and will need to be submitted by May 17.    We know our Tigers are anxious to enjoy a “more normal” experience in the fall, which will of course adhere to the advice of our medical experts, local public health officials, and CDC guidance. Our Show Me Renewal site will stay current with any changes along the way. There, you can also find the latest updates on the process for planning events. We see this step as a sign of hope for our university as we return to more in-person activity to serve our students, our community, and our state.    Thank you to everyone for your tremendous efforts during this extraordinary time. We are grateful to reach this point and for the rest of our community to join us on our beautiful campus.

Payment relief for individuals: The deadline to pay taxes owed on individual income tax returns with a due date of April 15, 2021, has been extended until May 17, 2021.  This relief applies to individual taxpayers, including those who pay self-employment tax. However, it does not apply to estimated tax payments that are due on April 15, 2021; that deadline has not changed.  Penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any remaining unpaid balances as of May 17, 2021. Individuals that file their return and pay their balance by May 17, 2021, will automatically avoid interest and penalties on the tax paid by May 17.  Customers may still ask for an extension of time to file their individual income taxes. With that extension, the return will not be due until October 15, 2021. However, any payments must still be made by May 17, 2021.  Earlier this year, the IRS announced that the nation’s 2021 electronic tax filing season would begin on February 12. On that date, the IRS began accepting and processing e-filed 2020 tax year returns. Since e-filed state returns are first sent to the IRS, the Department also began accepting and processing e-filed returns for the 2020 tax year on February 12.    “With a delayed start and recent tax code changes, this tax season is a particularly complicated one,” said Director of Revenue Ken Zellers. “For Missourians who have yet to file, we strongly encourage you to file electronically and use direct deposit, as it will result in the most accurate return and the fastest refund. We appreciate your patience as we navigate this tax season together, and we stand ready to assist you in any way we can.”    Department of Revenue online services and resources:    The Department’s Tax Return Status Tracker allows customers to enroll in automatic text and email alerts that are sent each time the status of their return is updated. Customers need their Social Security number, filing status, and anticipated refund or balance due to enroll and must re-enroll each year.

Many camps, events and some forms of travel have moved to requiring evidence of a negative test result prior to participation.    Testing capacity has grown significantly over the past year, and testing efforts have continuously evolved to meet existing needs.    Now, there are tests that have been authorized by the FDA for at-home usage. Those who need to be tested for COVID-19 and can’t get tested by a healthcare provider can consider using either a self-collection kit or a self-test that can be performed anywhere. Self-collection kits and tests are available either by prescription or over the counter in a pharmacy or retail store without a prescription. Currently available self-collection kits and tests are used for the detection of current infection. These tests either require a nasal or saliva specimen.    The availability of these tests increases access to testing which results in the ability to take appropriate public health action. However, following the self-collection directions carefully is important for the validity of the result. It is also important to follow directions for reporting of the test results as it ensures the continuity of public health surveillance and mitigation efforts    The State continues to offer community testing events in areas throughout the state in a regular weekly cadence. A new regular event in Branson has been added to the schedule. Community testing events are free COVID-19 testing options that are available to anyone without any specific reason needed for the testing.     No pre-registration or appointment is needed, and patients do not need to be Missouri residents to be tested. A government-issued ID is not required, but if available will shorten the onsite registration process. The test used at these community testing events is a PCR test done by an anterior nares swab to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Once tested, individuals will be notified of results no later than 72 hours from the end of the testing event.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210503141703/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/885a067c-2b1c-480a-a270-18333827f2da/more-covid-19-testing-options-increase-accessibility",1,NO FLAG,"On February 26, the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Service published that variants of the COVID-19 virus continue to develop around the world, and scientists in the United States and around the world continue to monitor them for their characteristics as they relate to infectivity, morbidity and response to available vaccines and treatments.

(Pfizer is the only vaccine authorized for those aged 16-17).     Approximately 750,000 Missouri residents are currently registered in Missouri Vaccine Navigator, which is powered by Qualtrics. The system allows individuals to register and schedule an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine by viewing vaccination events throughout the state.     In addition to helping individuals register for a vaccine, the Missouri Vaccine Navigator will remind registrants when it is time to schedule their second dose. Two of the vaccines currently authorized for use (Pfizer and Moderna) require two doses, and the second dose is critical to ensure individual and community protection.    The Missouri Vaccine Navigator also integrates with ShowMeVax, the state’s immunization database for providers. Vaccination events using the Missouri Vaccine Navigator for scheduling enables coordinators to quickly load vaccination administration data into the system and avoid cumbersome data entry.    Once an individual is registered with Missouri Vaccine Navigator, the scheduling platform becomes available and can be accessed as often as needed or until vaccination is achieved.

Until recently, DOH used a pro-rata approach for allocations, which means doses were allocated to counties proportionally to match the size of their populations. As vaccine supply has increased, the number of doses health care providers are requesting doesn’t always align with county pro-rata allocations. Moving forward, DOH will make allocation decisions based on individual provider requests for vaccine, in addition to population size. Transitioning to this allocation model moves us closer into alignment with our existing childhood and adult vaccine programs, which are both based on provider request. We will continue to work closely with partners to ensure vaccine is available and accessible to everyone who lives or works in Washington state.    “While the pro-rata driven model worked well for the first few months of vaccine distribution, now that nearly 30% of Washingtonians are fully vaccinated, it is time to adjust our approach in support of our goals to vaccinate more Washingtonians as equitably, quickly, and efficiently as possible,” said Lacy Fehrenbach, Deputy Secretary of the COVID-19 response.    Each week, providers will continue to order the amount of vaccine they need and DOH will get weekly input from local health jurisdictions (LHJ) on community vaccine priorities. DOH will approve orders based on provider request and LHJ recommendations. Using this method, DOH will be able to distribute vaccine to the communities that need it most, while also providing extra doses to providers who continue to see higher need for vaccine.    In order to ensure providers across the state have doses available to vaccinate their community members, DOH is also offering flexibility to certain providers with throughput and usage. This includes providers who serve smaller communities, support equity efforts, and/or reach special populations, such as hospitals that transfer patients to long-term care facilities. We want to make sure vaccine is available to these groups when they need it.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20210502015758/https://coronavirus.wa.gov/news/vaccine-allocation-strategy-moving-provider-need-based-approach"
