Missouri,MO,Wed 19 May 2021,1,1,1,"Original Note by Veronique Gauthier: On March 24, the University of Missouri published a press release about workers. Dear University faculty and staff,    Throughout this last year, you have proven yourselves resilient in a time of great uncertainty and steady change. We so appreciate your willingness to step up and keep us going.    Thankfully, effective – and increasingly available – COVID-19 vaccines, along with a decrease in active cases in our region, usher in new possibilities for how we can interact.    Next Monday (March 29), all of you, as higher education faculty and staff (including student employees), will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We strongly encourage you to sign up for a vaccine appointment. Please see our vaccine page here for links to options, which includes information to make an appointment as dates become available at our Faurot Field vaccine site. There, dedicated MU Health Care teams have already vaccinated nearly 23,000 people.    Over the last several months, many of you safely returned to in-person work, following our COVID-19 guidelines. Meanwhile in our community, public schools have announced plans to shift to full in-person attendance in early April and this week, Boone County relaxed public health orders. We expect this progress to continue as we approach fall and our plans to resume full-capacity classes and activities here at Mizzou.    As another step toward resuming our pre-pandemic lives, we ask faculty and staff who have not yet returned to in-person work to do so by May 17. Faculty on 9-month appointments without duties over the summer should plan to return in August. We are sending this message in advance to give you and your supervisor time to make a transition plan if needed.    As more faculty and staff return, we remain committed to sustaining a safe community. Social distancing and face covering requirements will continue until public health guidance changes. Supervisors will need to ensure work settings meet office safety expectations and consult with Campus Facilities if work spaces need modification.    We know ongoing efforts to maximize our resources, including the recent announcement to close buildings, mean some in-person offices will not be the same. In addition, we realize, in some settings, social distancing is not possible with a full in-person return and that factor should be considered in any transition plan. If you witness an unsafe situation at work related to our COVID-19 protocols, you should let your supervisor know or submit a concern here.    Through this transition, we expect to retain some of our COVID-era practices, as we found some enhanced our work. In some circumstances, supervisors may decide flexible work arrangements will best fit the environment and the work needed to support the university’s mission. If so, your supervisor will initiate, revise or extend a telework arrangement. The form is available on our Working Through COVID-19 webpage and will need to be submitted by May 17.    We know our Tigers are anxious to enjoy a “more normal” experience in the fall, which will of course adhere to the advice of our medical experts, local public health officials, and CDC guidance. Our Show Me Renewal site will stay current with any changes along the way. There, you can also find the latest updates on the process for planning events. We see this step as a sign of hope for our university as we return to more in-person activity to serve our students, our community, and our state.    Thank you to everyone for your tremendous efforts during this extraordinary time. We are grateful to reach this point and for the rest of our community to join us on our beautiful campus.

Those who should get tested include those experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, those who have had close contact with someone with confirmed COVID-19 (unless fully vaccinated or tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months), those with household contact, those who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk of infection, and those who have been recommended for testing by their healthcare provider or health department. Many camps, events and some forms of travel have moved to requiring evidence of a negative test result prior to participation.    Testing capacity has grown significantly over the past year, and testing efforts have continuously evolved to meet existing needs.    Now, there are tests that have been authorized by the FDA for at-home usage. Those who need to be tested for COVID-19 and can’t get tested by a healthcare provider can consider using either a self-collection kit or a self-test that can be performed anywhere. Self-collection kits and tests are available either by prescription or over the counter in a pharmacy or retail store without a prescription. Currently available self-collection kits and tests are used for the detection of current infection. These tests either require a nasal or saliva specimen.    The availability of these tests increases access to testing which results in the ability to take appropriate public health action. However, following the self-collection directions carefully is important for the validity of the result. It is also important to follow directions for reporting of the test results as it ensures the continuity of public health surveillance and mitigation efforts    The State continues to offer community testing events in areas throughout the state in a regular weekly cadence. A new regular event in Branson has been added to the schedule. Community testing events are free COVID-19 testing options that are available to anyone without any specific reason needed for the testing.     No pre-registration or appointment is needed, and patients do not need to be Missouri residents to be tested. A government-issued ID is not required, but if available will shorten the onsite registration process. The test used at these community testing events is a PCR test done by an anterior nares swab to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Once tested, individuals will be notified of results no later than 72 hours from the end of the testing event.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210503141703/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/885a067c-2b1c-480a-a270-18333827f2da/more-covid-19-testing-options-increase-accessibility",1,NO FLAG,"On May 14,The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) continues to partner with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the University of Missouri – Columbia, wastewater operators, and others to monitor COVID-19 trends by testing wastewater in communities throughout the state.    In February 2021, this team began testing wastewater samples to look for the presence of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Using a technique called high throughput sequencing, samples with sufficient COVID-19 genetic material are tested for genetic mutations, which are compared to mutations in known variants. The testing results are now displayed in a new layer of the COVID-19 sewershed surveillance StoryMap.    In press releases issued on February 26 and March 9, DHSS announced initial rounds of this testing, which suggested the B.1.1.7 (UK) variant virus was present in sewage samples in some locations throughout the state.    This sequencing testing now suggests the B.1.1.7 (UK) variant is present in all areas tested across the state. B.1.1.7 is considered a variant of concern in part due to evidence of its increased transmissibility. Other mutations associated with other variants of concern seen by this testing include B1.427/B.1.429 (South California), Brazil, and South African; however, these mutations have tended not to be as consistently present as the B.1.1.7.    Even though these mutations are present, viral load levels remain relatively stable. This stability suggests that efforts to minimize transmission of the virus are working, and stresses the importance of continued testing, vaccinations, and adherence to local recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.    Viruses constantly change through genetic mutation. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, several variants of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Some variants may have a selective advantage due to their specific mutations, which is why some variants can become dominant over the “parent” strain (original strain of the virus). Advantages may include how easily variants spreads from person to person.    For the genetic sequence testing, small sections of the total COVID-19 RNA strand are being analyzed. Because the entire genetic sequences are not being analyzed, the results do not confirm the presence of an actual variant; however, they are suggestive of the presence and distribution of variants across the state. While wastewater testing can be a useful tool for screening for the presence of variants, sequencing of a clinical specimen is required to confirm their presence.    “In some communities, we are consistently detecting the same mutation week after week, serving as a signal of the presence of these correlating variant(s) in the population. In other communities, results are inconsistent between weeks,” said Jeff Wenzel, Bureau Chief of Environmental Epidemiology. “Several reasons could cause this to happen. One possibility is travelers or visitors passing through could be contributing to variation, or person(s) cease shedding after recovery from the infection.”    Despite uncertainties, these results are useful for informing public health investigations and response for stopping the spread of COVID-19. Washing hands, wearing masks, testing, social distancing, and vaccinations have slowed the spread of the virus. The emergence of variants emphasizes the importance to continue efforts to minimize transmission including continued testing, becoming fully vaccinated, and adherence to local recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210517135131/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/31bcc035-ed09-4d40-976f-fc9136c81c38/dhss-provides-virus-variant-updates-from-wastewater-monitoring-project",3,0,"As of April 25, Kansas City still requires residents to wear facial coverings in public spaces.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210426104420/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/health/coronavirus-covid-19-kcmo-information-and-response/reopen",5,1,"On May 12, Robert Knodell, Acting Director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) and Dr. George Turabelidze, State Epidemiologist, signed the standing order for PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administration for individuals 12 to 15 years in the state of Missouri. This is following the decision by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to recommend to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the Pfizer vaccine be made available to administer to children ages 12-15 years. The vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Prior to this decision, the Pfizer vaccine was only approved for individuals age 16 and above.    In Missouri, this expanded authorization creates vaccine eligibility for approximately 313,000 additional individuals.     The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, at least three weeks apart, for all eligible individuals. It is important to receive the second dose for maximum protection against COVID-19.    COVID-19 vaccinations for those 12 years and older are available from any provider offering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. DHSS continues to enroll pediatricians into State’s COVID-19 vaccine program so they can order COVID-19 vaccines and administer them to their patients. Additionally, schools may consider partnering with a local public health agency or other provider to set up vaccination clinics for students.    The Moderna and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccines continue to be available to individuals age 18 and older. Those seeking vaccination should visit MOStopsCovid.com to find vaccination sites and events. State-supported events and vaccination sites can be found at this site. Individuals can also register in Missouri Vaccine Navigator and find appointment options in the following languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and French. Some local providers also accept walk-ins.     In most situations, a parent or guardian must be present for an individual under the age of 18 to receive the vaccine. In some settings, written consent from a parent or guardian may also be permissible.      In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 among participants ages 12-15. The side effects in adolescents were similar with those reported in clinical trial participants 16 years of age and older and included pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, and fever.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210517134903/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/25ecab6d-9662-450f-b160-a211aef4170d/dhss-authorizes-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-administration-for-adolescents"

The guidelines are as follows:  Requirements have changed effective May 14, 2021. However, it is important to remember that people with COVID-19 can spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you from getting or spreading COVID-19.    If You Are Fully Vaccinated:  Anyone who is fully vaccinated is not required to wear a mask or maintain a 6-foot distance from others. You are fully vaccinated 14 days after your final shot.    There are some exceptions, and you will need to wear a mask in schools, health care settings, long term care facilities, correctional facilities and on public transportation. Businesses or municipalities can also require you to wear a mask if they choose to do so.    If You Are Unvaccinated or Partially Vaccinated (including children):  These individuals must follow the current mask requirements:    1. INDOORS: You are required to wear a face mask or covering in indoor public spaces in Vermont. Indoor public spaces include businesses, public buildings, and group living settings (such as long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).  In indoor private settings, we recommend that you wear a mask anytime people who are not fully vaccinated get together (for example, at a gathering with family and friends or riding in a car). Check the current limits on gatherings and events.    2. OUTDOORS: When you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you can’t maintain a 6-foot distance.    Vermonters can decide whether they need a mask by considering three elements:  •	Outside  •	Masked  •	Distanced    You need two of these three elements. For example – if you’re outside and distanced, you don’t need a mask. If you’re outside and not distanced, wear a mask. And if you’re not outside, you should wear a mask and keep a distance.    Masks are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also not required for – and should not be worn by:  •	Children under the age of 2  •	Anyone who has trouble breathing  •	Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance  •	Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask    If you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.    Businesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).
