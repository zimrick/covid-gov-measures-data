United States,USA,Thu 15 Apr 2021,0,2,0,"As of April 5, at least 12 states require in-person instruction to be available in all or some grades either full- or part-time. This includes Iowa, West Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and Arkansas to fully open K-12, with partial reopenings required by Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Massachusetts. All other states continue to operate with a mix of remote, hybrid, and in-person learning across grade levels.

At the state level, many states continue to use re-opening frameworks based on Covid-19 prevalence (and some have lifted capacity limits completely). For example, in Colorado counties fall into one of six color-coded levels of risk. Under level green, the least restrictive, most businesses can operate without restrictions. Indoor bars and indoor entertainment venues must limit capacity to 50 percent or 500 people, whichever is smaller. In level-blue counties, restaurants and gyms can operate at 100 percent capacity as long as parties maintain a 6-foot distance from one another. Indoor bars can operate at 25 percent capacity, with a maximum of 75 patrons. Retail stores can operate at 75 percent capacity.    On March 31, 2021, Governor Holcomb of Indiana signed Executive Order 20-9, extending the statewide mask mandate until April 6 and a county-by-county approach to restrictions. After that, the health department will offer a mask advisory and guidance on gatherings, but it will be up to local authorities and businesses to implement restrictions. Under current restrictions, counties designated as red or orange (areas with the highest risk of coronavirus spread) must limit social gatherings to 25 percent of a facility’s capacity. Counties designated as yellow must limit gatherings to 50 percent of a facility’s capacity. Counties designated as blue can operate at full capacity, as long as social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions are followed.     Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards is lifting some restrictions on businesses as of March 31 through Proclamation number 66 JBE 2021. The majority of businesses, including restaurants, bars, gyms and hair salons, no longer have capacity limits. Businesses must continue to keep waiting areas closed, and restaurants still cannot allow self-serve buffets.

If a venue of 100,000 square feet or more has an outdoor occupancy limit, it must restrict capacity to 50 percent. If an outdoor venue of 100,000 square feet or under has an outdoor occupancy limit, it must restrict capacity to 75 percent. With permission from the health department, outdoor gatherings of more than 150 people are allowed. Public indoor events continue to be limited to 50 percent of the venue’s fire occupancy or 25 people (whichever is smaller). With permission from the health department, public indoor gatherings of up to 150 people are allowed.    In Maine, outdoor gatherings at a venue with occupancy limits can operate at 75 percent capacity until May 24, when they can increase to 100 percent capacity.     In Mississippi, events at indoor arenas are permitted to operate at 75 percent seating capacity. K-12 organized events, such as sports competitions, are limited to 50 percent capacity.    In Rhode Island, venues of assembly, such as concert halls and spectator-sport facilities, can operate indoors at 50 percent capacity, with a cap of 250 people (if outdoors, the cap is 500).

Missouri,MO,Thu 15 Apr 2021,1,1,1,"On March 24, the University of Missouri published a press release about workers. Dear University faculty and staff,    Throughout this last year, you have proven yourselves resilient in a time of great uncertainty and steady change. We so appreciate your willingness to step up and keep us going.    Thankfully, effective – and increasingly available – COVID-19 vaccines, along with a decrease in active cases in our region, usher in new possibilities for how we can interact.    Next Monday (March 29), all of you, as higher education faculty and staff (including student employees), will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We strongly encourage you to sign up for a vaccine appointment. Please see our vaccine page here for links to options, which includes information to make an appointment as dates become available at our Faurot Field vaccine site. There, dedicated MU Health Care teams have already vaccinated nearly 23,000 people.    Over the last several months, many of you safely returned to in-person work, following our COVID-19 guidelines. Meanwhile in our community, public schools have announced plans to shift to full in-person attendance in early April and this week, Boone County relaxed public health orders. We expect this progress to continue as we approach fall and our plans to resume full-capacity classes and activities here at Mizzou.    As another step toward resuming our pre-pandemic lives, we ask faculty and staff who have not yet returned to in-person work to do so by May 17. Faculty on 9-month appointments without duties over the summer should plan to return in August. We are sending this message in advance to give you and your supervisor time to make a transition plan if needed.    As more faculty and staff return, we remain committed to sustaining a safe community. Social distancing and face covering requirements will continue until public health guidance changes. Supervisors will need to ensure work settings meet office safety expectations and consult with Campus Facilities if work spaces need modification.    We know ongoing efforts to maximize our resources, including the recent announcement to close buildings, mean some in-person offices will not be the same. In addition, we realize, in some settings, social distancing is not possible with a full in-person return and that factor should be considered in any transition plan. If you witness an unsafe situation at work related to our COVID-19 protocols, you should let your supervisor know or submit a concern here.    Through this transition, we expect to retain some of our COVID-era practices, as we found some enhanced our work. In some circumstances, supervisors may decide flexible work arrangements will best fit the environment and the work needed to support the university’s mission. If so, your supervisor will initiate, revise or extend a telework arrangement. The form is available on our Working Through COVID-19 webpage and will need to be submitted by May 17.    We know our Tigers are anxious to enjoy a “more normal” experience in the fall, which will of course adhere to the advice of our medical experts, local public health officials, and CDC guidance. Our Show Me Renewal site will stay current with any changes along the way. There, you can also find the latest updates on the process for planning events. We see this step as a sign of hope for our university as we return to more in-person activity to serve our students, our community, and our state.    Thank you to everyone for your tremendous efforts during this extraordinary time. We are grateful to reach this point and for the rest of our community to join us on our beautiful campus.

The IRS has said it will issue formal guidance in the coming days.    The Department of Revenue will automatically provide this filing and payment relief, so filers do not need to take any action to qualify.    Guidance on extension to file and pay individual income tax:    Filing deadline extended: The deadline to file individual income tax returns has been extended from April 15, 2021, to May 17, 2021.  Payment relief for individuals: The deadline to pay taxes owed on individual income tax returns with a due date of April 15, 2021, has been extended until May 17, 2021.  This relief applies to individual taxpayers, including those who pay self-employment tax. However, it does not apply to estimated tax payments that are due on April 15, 2021; that deadline has not changed.  Penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any remaining unpaid balances as of May 17, 2021. Individuals that file their return and pay their balance by May 17, 2021, will automatically avoid interest and penalties on the tax paid by May 17.  Customers may still ask for an extension of time to file their individual income taxes. With that extension, the return will not be due until October 15, 2021. However, any payments must still be made by May 17, 2021.  Earlier this year, the IRS announced that the nation’s 2021 electronic tax filing season would begin on February 12. On that date, the IRS began accepting and processing e-filed 2020 tax year returns. Since e-filed state returns are first sent to the IRS, the Department also began accepting and processing e-filed returns for the 2020 tax year on February 12.    “With a delayed start and recent tax code changes, this tax season is a particularly complicated one,” said Director of Revenue Ken Zellers. “For Missourians who have yet to file, we strongly encourage you to file electronically and use direct deposit, as it will result in the most accurate return and the fastest refund. We appreciate your patience as we navigate this tax season together, and we stand ready to assist you in any way we can.”    Department of Revenue online services and resources:    The Department’s Tax Return Status Tracker allows customers to enroll in automatic text and email alerts that are sent each time the status of their return is updated. Customers need their Social Security number, filing status, and anticipated refund or balance due to enroll and must re-enroll each year.

""Today marks the activation of Phase 2 of our state's Vaccination Plan, and I cannot thank our Missouri National Guard, DHSS, and FEMA personnel as well as our countless state, local, and private partners enough for their efforts,"" Governor Parson said. ""With nearly 3.9 million adult Missourians now eligible, we have come a long way since vaccines first arrived in Missouri. This has truly been a team effort and will continue to be as we keep making progress toward our goal of providing every Missourian the opportunity for a vaccine.""    The activation of Phase 2 will extend vaccine eligibility to approximately 880,000 additional adult Missourians. In total, an estimated 3.9 million adult Missourians are eligible and activated for a COVID-19 vaccine.

This also includes homeless and disproportionately affected populations with an emphasis on racial and ethnic minorities, among others.

At the state's two-day Mega Vaccination Event at St. Louis Community College – Forest Park, 6,600 Missourians were fully vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine. The state-supported clinics at The Family Arena in St. Charles and Greensfelder Recreation Complex at Queeny Park administered 9,000 and over 4,450 initial doses, respectively.     To date, Missouri providers have administered more than 2.34 million total doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Missourians across the state. More than 1.5 million Missourians, nearly 25 percent, have received an initial vaccine dose, and more than 875,000 have been fully vaccinated.     Additionally, data shows that nearly 40 percent of the approximately three million Missourians who were eligible prior to Phase 2 have initiated vaccination.

This does not mean that every health district will immediately be able to vaccinate any adult.

Texas,TX,Thu 15 Apr 2021,1,2,0,"As of April 5, 2021 Texas schools still have freedom to decide whether or not to follow the Texas Education Agency (TEA) released guidelines based on the new executive order GA 34. TEA updated guidelines, now recommend a distance of three feet in schools but encourage 6 feet when possible. Masks should be worn by students, teachers and staff members, whenever it is not possible to maintain 3 feet social distancing. TEA recommends that public school systems consult with their local public health authorities and local legal counsel before making final decisions regarding the implementation of this guidance.    Most Texas school districts remain open, but also offer virtual learning. Many continue to provide daily, on-campus learning for any family who wants it in order to not lose state funding due to declines in enrollment. School districts can require individual students who are falling behind academically to return to in-person classes.    Mostly all Texas Universities have chosen to keep COVID-19 policies in place, even though Governor Abbott ended the mask mandate (MArch 10th, 2021).
