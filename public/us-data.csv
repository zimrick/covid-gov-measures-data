When a person in Connecticut is diagnosed with COVID-19, the state attempts to interview them and everyone with whom they have come into contact.    In total, Connecticut attempted interviews on 158,330 cases and 58,747 contacts between August and January.

Here's how it works:    When you test positive for COVID-19, in addition to providing you with support, the lab that tested you loads your test data onto the State's secure epidemiological surveillance system called the Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS).  Your positive case is then shared with your Local Health Department, who will call you to determine close contacts that you may have spread the virus to.  A close contact is anyone you spent 15 minutes or more with over a 24-hour period and were within 6 feet of while you were infectious (2 days before onset of symptoms to 10 days after, or two days before your positive test if you didn't have any symptoms).  Contact tracers – trained professionals from the community -- get in touch with your contacts to recommend next steps like self-quarantining and to share resources about how those people can get tested.  NOTE: Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status  Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, how they should monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.  Local Health Departments across New Jersey have been conducting contact tracing for COVID-19 since the State identified the first case on March 4.
