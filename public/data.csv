In conjunction  with active case finding and testing, and in synergy with other measures such as physical  distancing, contact tracing is recommended in all transmission scenarios.  According to current knowledge, COVID 19 is passed from one person to another primarily  through droplet transmission. People in close contact with COVID-19 cases are at high  risk of being infected with COVID-19, and, if infected, may also transmit the infection to  others. This guideline details how once a COVID-19 case has been identified, the Ministry  of Health and Wellness (MoHW) through District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and  other implementing partners will track, trace and manage people who may have been  exposed to COVID-19.

Kiribati,KIR,Thu 06.05.2021,2,"Article suggests that Kiribati has a suspected case of Covid-19 (a person from Papua New Guinea who recently came to Kiribati on a flight from Fiji on 19th March).    The article also refers to the provision of information about Covid-19 on multiple media channels (radio, TV and internet) by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), hence the change of code for H1 from ""0"" to ""2"".  It is entirely possible that a coordinated campaign has been in existence prior to this, although no policy announcement about such a campaign has been found.    ""People were also kept reminded by the MHMS over radio Kiribati, the media and tv of steps to combat with the deadly convid-19 on all levels.    On the island people had their hand-held mobile smart telephone on site with them for any current viral news for the corona virus updates.

Notes that a suspected Covid case (a captain of a ship) had been tested for Covid-19 and the results had come back negative.  This suggests a policy of testing is in existence and is likely to have been in place prior to 28th March, although no policy on testing has been found, so code prior to this has been left as ""0"".  The tests were carried out in Australia.  It is assumed that reliance on other countries for testing will mean that testing is limited to symptomatic / suspected cases and is not available more widely.      Link:  http://archive.today/2021.01.26-174948/https://kiribatiupdates.com.ki/convid-19-results-proof-negative-in-tarawa/    Subsequent Facebook posts by the Australian High Commission for Kiribati notes the delivery of testing supplies and equipment (GeneXpert) on 1st May, 21st May, 25th August and 9th November 2020 which suggests that testing capacity within Kiribati progressively increases over the coming months.  A further post by the High Commission on 12th November comments on support provided for Kiribati to develop a PCR lab at Tungaru Central Hospital which will reduce its need for sending samples overseas for testing.  Taken as a whole, these comments suggest that whilst testing capacity increases, it has remained limited and is therefore unlikely to meet coding criteria for ""2"" or ""3"" throughout 2020.    Additional context: borders remained closed from March 2020 and Kiribati has continued to report no confirmed cases of Covid-19 throughout 2020.
