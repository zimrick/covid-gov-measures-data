(2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis.
