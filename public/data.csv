Jamaica,JAM,Wed 23.06.2021,2,"""Minister of Health and Wellness, Dr. the Hon. Christopher Tufton, says a Ministry-led national public education campaign is under way to heighten citizens’ awareness about the novel coronavirus.  Addressing journalists at a media briefing at the Ministry’s offices in New Kingston on February 5, Dr. Tufton said newspaper advertisements have commenced, and there are social media postings on his personal page as well as those of the Ministry and Regional Health Authorities.  “I understand we will hear some radio ads coming out soon,” the Minister added.  “We would have done a series of interviews… myself [and] the various medical team members. I get a call almost every day for a comment… and I try to respond because I know it’s important."" https://web.archive.org/web/20200416163126/https://jis.gov.jm/public-education-campaign-to-heighten-awareness-about-coronavirus/",3,"Are PCR and/or antigen tests available for U.S. citizens in Jamaica?

Effective immediately, mortgagors who are laid off can apply for a moratorium on all loan payments of three months in the first instance. The NHT will also provide a special one-off offer to contributors, the option to reschedule delinquent loans. The option will only be made available where the Trust has not already entered into a commitment to dispose of the property.    The opportunity will be extended for 6 months, effective April 1, 2020. During this period, the NHT will consider each mortgage on a case-by-case basis, with the option to extend the tenor of the loan or reduce the interest rate.    The measures include:    - Effective April 1, 2020 the NHT will reduce interest rates on all new loans by 1% (benefitting some 8,000 new mortgagors annually)  - All existing NHT loans will be reduced by 0.5% (benefitting some100,000 existing mortgagors).  Interest rate discounts currently offered to special groups, such as mortgagors aged 55 years and over, the disabled as well as public sector workers will continue.  - The interest rate discounts for the disabled will be effective April 1, 2020 and will also be extended to include the parents of disabled children.  - The NHT will expand the Intergenerational Mortgage Program. Beginning April 1, 2020, the NHT will extend this benefit for eligible applicants for other loan products, such as open market purchases and construction loans. Funding under this Program will be capped at the prevailing loan limit.  - The NHT will also provide greater benefits to contributors over 65 years. Persons in this category will be designated as Voluntary Contributors and therefore be able to access housing benefits with tenures extending up to age 70.  - The NHT will establish a special arrangement whereby, following maturity of the loan, the insurance arrangement at special rates may be continued. The cost savings will enable beneficiaries to continue the protection of their properties in a period of life when their earning power may be at its lowest.  - The NHT will, during FY2020/21, seek to leverage its current mortgage loan portfolio through a securitization transaction to generate additional inflows.    Covid Student’s Loan Bureau  Jamaica will be deferring principal and interest payments on student loans for the three-month period April – June to cushion the impact on young graduates while giving new graduates 14 months to start payment their student loans after graduation.

A further post by the High Commission on 12th November comments on support provided for Kiribati to develop a PCR lab at Tungaru Central Hospital which will reduce its need for sending samples overseas for testing.

This is on top of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which rely on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology and are being used in the national vaccine drive. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will now also allow Covid-19 vaccines that are approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation (WHO), it said on Monday. Besides Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the WHO has also green-lit the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Indian Covishield vaccines. But individuals who want to take these shots will do so at their own cost and risk - in contrast with the official vaccine roll-out, which is free for all long-term residents. The government will not subsidise vaccines given under the Special Access Route (SAR), and those who get such vaccines are not eligible for the scheme that grants one-time goodwill financial assistance for serious vaccine side effects. The MOH noted that ""there has been interest to access alternate vaccines used in other countries"", especially for those with medical conditions, such as pregnancy or life-threatening allergies; these individuals were previously excluded from the two mRNA vaccines. ""However, there have either been no applications for approval of these alternate vaccines in Singapore, or evaluation is still ongoing,"" it added, referring to the vaccine, which is not yet approved by the Health Sciences Authority. The authorities will therefore let WHO-approved emergency-use vaccine brands be used by private healthcare providers under the SAR, for as long as the pandemic lasts.""
